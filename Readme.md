ERP Backend
Overview
This repository contains the backend implementation of an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. The erp-backend is designed to manage core business processes, such as inventory, sales, and customer data, through a robust and scalable API.
Features

Modular Architecture: Organized codebase for easy maintenance and scalability.
RESTful API: Provides endpoints for managing various ERP functionalities.
Database Integration: Supports integration with relational databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
Authentication: Secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
Extensibility: Easily extendable to add new modules or features.

Getting Started
Prerequisites

Node.js (v16 or higher)
npm or yarn
A relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
Git

Installation

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/123mohdasif/erp.git


Navigate to the project directory:cd erp


Install dependencies:npm install


Configure environment variables:
Create a .env file in the root directory.
Add necessary configurations (e.g., database URL, API keys):DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
PORT=3000
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret




Set up the database:
Run migrations to create the necessary tables:npm run migrate




Start the server:  npm start



Running the Application

The server will start on http://localhost:3000 (or the port specified in .env).
Use tools like Postman or cURL to test the API endpoints.

API Endpoints
Below are some example endpoints (update with actual endpoints as implemented):

GET /api/users: Retrieve a list of users.
POST /api/auth/login: Authenticate a user and return a JWT token.
POST /api/inventory: Add a new inventory item.
GET /api/sales: Retrieve sales data.

Refer to the API documentation (if available) or the source code for a complete list of endpoints.
